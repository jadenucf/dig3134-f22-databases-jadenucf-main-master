# Unit 3: Databases

We will explore multiple different database paradigms in this unit, through the lens of using NodeJS to interact with them. This includes the popular MongoDB in Module 7, whose focus on documents and similarity to JSON makes it simpler to integrate into an application without developing a schema first.

The starter code is provided for Module 7, but will be released for future modules in this unit as zip files.
